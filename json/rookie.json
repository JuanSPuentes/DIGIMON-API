Once it\u2019s opened up to someone, though, it is quick to become close friends with them, and will happily show off its favorite treasures, which it keeps hidden among its quills.

Lucemon\u2019s special move is Grand Cross, which involves firing a collection of ten super-heated spheres of light arranged into the shape of a cross as if they were planets in alignment. This attack is even more destructive than Seraphimon\u2019s special move Strike of the Seven Stars."
