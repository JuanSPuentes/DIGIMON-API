Beelzemon always keeps its beloved shotguns, the Berejena, close at hand, and it rides around on its giant motorcycle machine Behemoth.It has a cruel and ruthless personality, but it never appears in groups or attacks the weak due to its pride. Its signature move is Darkness Claw, where it raises its sharp claws into the air and then slices through its foe. Its special move, Double Impact, involves firing twin blasts from its two shotguns.\n\n\u25a0Effects of the X Antibody on Beelzemon\u2019s DigiCore:\nWhen Beelzemon (X Antibody)\u2019s data was overwritten by the X Antibody, it gained the ability to summon the ever-shifting crimson flame El Evangelio from the Dark Area at will. El Evangelio is a sentient flame used to judge and purify the souls of sinners who fall into the Dark Area. Ordinarily, an Evil King like Beelzemon (X Antibody) would be utterly destroyed by it, DigiCore and all, but since Beelzemon (X Antibody) has taken in the X Antibody, it is safe from the fire. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s said to have the power to suppress El Evangelio\u2019s will, manipulating the sentient flame as it sees fit. When Beelzemon (X Antibody) uses its special move Gluttony Flare to fire El Evangelio from the Berejena like a bullet, its target is utterly consumed as if by fire, leaving no trace of data behind. Beelzemon (X Antibody) also has the special move Seventh Full Cluster, where it uses the Crown of Gluttony to concentrate the destructive power of its Gluttony Flare before firing."

Chaosdramon, with its crimson metal body, is an even more advanced version of Machinedramon. Its frame is made from Red Digizoid, a rare metal made by re-refining the virtual super-metal Chrome Digizoid to increase its hardness. As a result, it\u2019s capable of repelling all manner of attacks, and destroying absolutely anything. What\u2019s more, the program installed in its DigiCore updated autonomously to encourage even more destructive behavior. Chaosdramon is primarily used as an agent by the leader of the Crack Team. Its special move Hyper Infinity Cannon fires super-dreadnought class energy blasts from both of its cannons.\n\n\u25a0Effects of the X Antibody on Chaosdramon (X Antibody)\u2019s DigiCore:\nChaosdramon (X Antibody) has several times the strength and firepower of Machinedramon, a fellow Mega, but since it\u2019s so fiercely independent and destructive, it is difficult to control, and will only serve a master of its own choosing. Though it\u2019s not as fast as it used to be due to the heavy weight of its Red Digizoid, it does have the new special move Super Eradication Attack. This involves grabbing hold of a foe using the Chaos Crusher on its right arm, tearing off that enemy\u2019s armor, then blasting them with organic missiles from that same arm while they\u2019re vulnerable. Its new Red Digizoid is what makes this attack possible, as otherwise such a powerful blast being fired from point blank range would be an act of self-destruction."

Fanglongmon has eight eyes and twelve DigiCores outside of its body, which itself is covered in particles of Huanglong Ore, a special mineral boasting incredible hardness that prevents it from suffering any injuries. It uses its special move Taikyoku to continuously dismantle all things in the Digital World into the extremes of light and dark, soon turning them into nothingness. With Yellow Circle, it creates a giant typhoon of sediment on the scale of a natural disaster.\nHuanglong Ore\nThis material, which is based on Chrome Digizoit, is a virtual mineral boasting absolute hardness. Only Huanglong Ore can scratch Huanglong Ore. No technique can successfully compare it to other minerals or metals, so the actual limits of its strength cannot be measured. Although it is hard, it is also extremely dense, making it unsuitable for weapons or armor. Huanglong Ore is quite rare, and is only found in the deepest parts of the earth. It is said that it takes many years to unite this ore with a living thing\u2014longer than the age of folklore. As things stand now, Fanglongmon is the only Digimon discovered to have unified with this super-hard ore. Chrome Digizoit eliminates these flaws, making for an outstanding rare metal."

It has the ability to sense signs of impending chaos and other disturbances throughout the Digital World, allowing it to rush to these scenes faster than any other Royal Knights. It\u2019s also trusting of others, and in part to keep itself from growing overconfident, it prefers to coordinate its efforts with the Sistermon siblings and other Digimon nearby rather than acting alone. In this it is unlike most other Royal Knights. Learning by watching the Hinukamuy of its master Gankoomon, Jesmon acquired Atho, Ren\u00e9, and Por during its training. This trio performs formidable, autonomous movements according to Jesmon\u2019s instructions: attacking foes directly, backing up Jesmon, or providing aid to other Digimon. Jesmon uses its special move Judgement of the Blade to instantly slice its foe with its arm blades at high speeds, and Weltgeist to perform an omnidirectional counter together with Atho, Ren\u00e9, Por, intercepting any enemy attacks with their nine blades. It can use Aus Generics to temporarily overwrite its own data, making it capable of activity exceeding physical limitations. Jesmon\u2019s mobility defies the laws of the Digital World in this state, allowing it to subdue any Digimon without a single injury.\n\n\u25a0Effects of the X Antibody on Jesmon (X Antibody)\u2019s DigiCore:\nThe X Antibody transformed all of Jesmon (X Antibody)\u2019s armor into blades, granting it a form that\u2019s even more focused on offense. Each of the many swords Jesmon (X Antibody) is now equipped with is also capable of autonomous movement, allowing the Digimon to continually overwhelm opponents when fighting one-on-one with a constant string of attacks. Furthermore, the three programs Atho, Ren\u00e9, and Por have now fused and awakened as a single being, the Tactical Arms. This allows Jesmon (X Antibody) to make use of an entirely new combat style where it attacks in all directions without ever leaving itself open.\n\nThis Digimon\u2019s special moves include Iron-Fist Judgment, where it uses its new Tactical Arms to bludgeon foes with iron fists that would do Gankoomon proud, and Weltfl\u00fcgel, which involves pointing all the swords on its body towards an enemy, flying towards them, and unleashing a flurry of attacks while also fighting with the greatswords in its hands. Finally, it has a nonlethal ace in the hole, where it draws the Ultimate Seibaken out of the DigiCore in its chest and slices through foes. Those cut by this sword lose only their instinct for conflict, rendering them unable to battle any longer."

        "profile": "Profile\nThis Digimon god of smithing is one of the Olympos XII. Vulcanusmon is responsible for creating most of the Digital World\u2019s best-known weapons, including the infamous Beelzemon\u2019s beloved Berejena. Vulcanusmon has the spirit of a true craftsman, along with an obstinate personality. It takes the measure of all of its clients, and if it feels that they cannot master or will not treasure the weapon they\u2019ve requested, it will deny them. Even when it does agree to make a weapon, it matches the quality of its work to its impression of the wielder. In spite of this, it\u2019s said that Vulcanusmon was so taken with Beelzemon\u2019s strength that it worked diligently to craft an exceptional weapon when it created Berejena. Vulcanusmon prefers to be left in peace, working away with its eight arms, but it can also leverage its skill as a craftsman in battle. With Pinpoint Weapon Works, it makes masterful use of its fiery Bomber Art welder to instantly craft the perfect weapon for any combat situation. When it really wants to go all out, though, it will make repeated use of Pinpoint Weapon Works to make weapons for each of its eight arms. This technique is called Appropriate Works. Still, Vulcanusmon\u2019s own combat ability isn\u2019t especially high, and it prefers to avoid battle when it can."

Much like its Brave Shield, its Dramon Killer have also attained ultimate toughness, giving it perfect instruments of both offense and defense. WarGreymon (X Antibody) has sacrificed its capability for long flight, equipping vernier thrusters on its back that boast explosive acceleration and allow it to instantly close the distance to the enemy. This fighting style makes it the \u201cLand War Hero,\u201d the ultimate form of ground combat Digimon. Its special move Terra Force Zero involves quickly closing with a foe and unleashing its Terra Force, making the attack practically impossible to avoid.
