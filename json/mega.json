Beelzemon always keeps its beloved shotguns, the Berejena, close at hand, and it rides around on its giant motorcycle machine Behemoth.It has a cruel and ruthless personality, but it never appears in groups or attacks the weak due to its pride. Its signature move is Darkness Claw, where it raises its sharp claws into the air and then slices through its foe. Its special move, Double Impact, involves firing twin blasts from its two shotguns.\n\n\u25a0Effects of the X Antibody on Beelzemon\u2019s DigiCore:\nWhen Beelzemon (X Antibody)\u2019s data was overwritten by the X Antibody, it gained the ability to summon the ever-shifting crimson flame El Evangelio from the Dark Area at will. El Evangelio is a sentient flame used to judge and purify the souls of sinners who fall into the Dark Area. Ordinarily, an Evil King like Beelzemon (X Antibody) would be utterly destroyed by it, DigiCore and all, but since Beelzemon (X Antibody) has taken in the X Antibody, it is safe from the fire. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s said to have the power to suppress El Evangelio\u2019s will, manipulating the sentient flame as it sees fit. When Beelzemon (X Antibody) uses its special move Gluttony Flare to fire El Evangelio from the Berejena like a bullet, its target is utterly consumed as if by fire, leaving no trace of data behind. Beelzemon (X Antibody) also has the special move Seventh Full Cluster, where it uses the Crown of Gluttony to concentrate the destructive power of its Gluttony Flare before firing."

Chaosdramon, with its crimson metal body, is an even more advanced version of Machinedramon. Its frame is made from Red Digizoid, a rare metal made by re-refining the virtual super-metal Chrome Digizoid to increase its hardness. As a result, it\u2019s capable of repelling all manner of attacks, and destroying absolutely anything. What\u2019s more, the program installed in its DigiCore updated autonomously to encourage even more destructive behavior. Chaosdramon is primarily used as an agent by the leader of the Crack Team. Its special move Hyper Infinity Cannon fires super-dreadnought class energy blasts from both of its cannons.\n\n\u25a0Effects of the X Antibody on Chaosdramon (X Antibody)\u2019s DigiCore:\nChaosdramon (X Antibody) has several times the strength and firepower of Machinedramon, a fellow Mega, but since it\u2019s so fiercely independent and destructive, it is difficult to control, and will only serve a master of its own choosing. Though it\u2019s not as fast as it used to be due to the heavy weight of its Red Digizoid, it does have the new special move Super Eradication Attack. This involves grabbing hold of a foe using the Chaos Crusher on its right arm, tearing off that enemy\u2019s armor, then blasting them with organic missiles from that same arm while they\u2019re vulnerable. Its new Red Digizoid is what makes this attack possible, as otherwise such a powerful blast being fired from point blank range would be an act of self-destruction."
