This light maintains an extraordinary durability in the amethyst when one\u2019s heart is true, but the substance turns brittle the moment negativity arises in the heart of any who wield it. Lobomon has a chivalrous spirit and puts its life on the line for what it believes in, and hates injustice. Taciturn and rarely concerning itself with others, many believe it to be an unfeeling creature, but this warrior is actually kind-hearted. Lobomon uses its special move Licht Sieger to split the enemy in two with its Licht Schwert light swords, or Zwei Sieger to connect these twin swords before cutting the opponent to pieces."
