        "profile": "Profile\nA Puppet Digimon whose whole body is made of special plastic yo-yos. Yoxtu!Yoxtu!mon was supposedly born from video data demonstrating skillful technique at yo-yo tournaments. It has a short temper, constantly glaring around with sharp looks. It uses the spiked yo-yo on its right hand for mincing, and the bladeless yo-yo on its left hand for battering, depending on the battle situation. Yoxtu!Yoxtu!mon uses its special move Rapper Coaster to rhythmically slice up its foe with its right hand, and One-Handed Swing to smack the enemy with a huge swing of its left hand. It also uses Torpedo Crossing to spin its entire body before ramming into its foe, but the need for a partner to wind its string back up is a real drawback."

Its new form perfectly embodies that spirit, and ZubaEagermon is committed to constantly forging ahead, over good terrain and bad, even if it\u2019s reduced to a crawl.\nIts special moves include Road T(w)o Decade, where it charges straight towards a foe while shouting \u201cTwentieeest!\u201d and Vantheon, where it curls up into a ball and spins, slicing through enemies with the blade on its tail. In its sword form, which it is quite proud of, it will cut its way through any foe with all its strength."
