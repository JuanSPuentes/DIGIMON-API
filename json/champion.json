Its aesthetics are evident in its hit-and-run tactics. Its special move Power Attack is incredibly powerful, indeed."

Specialized in offense, its extreme combat instinct accompanies a ruthless and brutal nature that won\u2019t stop until the opponent is annihilated. Normal Digimon cannot approach Greymon, as they are kept at bay from the bizarre fighting spirit it emanates. Its Mega Flame shoots a flame that burns the vicinity, and its Atomic Tail hammers foes in a 360 degree arc. The charge technique Horn Strike is effective for both approach and retreat, and its sturdy frame lets it display tremendous fighting strength in close-quarters combat. Each skill has immense destructive power. Between its actions and wit, defeating Greymon in close-range combat is nigh-impossible. It won\u2019t even show mercy to its own kind, meaning using Greymon is nothing if not infeasible."
