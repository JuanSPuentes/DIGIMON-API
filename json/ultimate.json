Ghilliedhumon is an incredibly adept hunter, and its camouflage-covered body allows it to blend in with the forest and strike without giving its position away to its prey. Though Ghilliedhumon has a peaceful disposition, it is very territorial over its hunting grounds, and those who carelessly wander into its domain will be sniped without warning. Ghilliedhumon prefers slow movements to avoid leaving any signs or making any sound. As such, it struggles to move swiftly. Ghilliedhumon's eyes have special abilities, and its True Sight skill allows it to see even inside Digimon prey, and accurately locate their Digicores. Ghilliedhumon then uses its trusty rifle, \"Bellota,\" to perform its Core Snipe move and finish off its targets."

It also overwrote the data on its arms to allow it to crush any tainted data it finds using its powerful jaws.\nWith its special move Inferno Divide, it can blast foes with firebombs at point blank range while it holds them in place, which it does by biting them with the massive heads on the ends of its arms.

The majority of the Earth Spirit Army troops are God Beast Digimon, making them an overwhelming force to be reckoned with. Gravimon treats the battlefield as a testing ground, where it enjoys exploring various fascinating strategies. It is a Digimon brimming with curiosity and passionate about continuing its research. How easily can the number of casualties be maximized? Which strategy will lead to the most cries of anguish? What brilliant tactic will astonish friend and foe alike as they perish? How can the enemy be wiped out without spilling a single drop of blood? These are the sorts of questions it longs to answer. In battle, Gravimon uses its eight tentacles to manipulate gravity with the move Octogravity, controlling the weight of its foes to best suit its strategy. It can also stretch out and enlarge its arms to grab an enemy, then crush them with overwhelming force by using High Gravity Pressure. Its legendary Gravity Bang attack involves concentrating as much of the Digital World\u2019s gravity upon itself as possible, then setting off a massive explosion by releasing all that energy at once. This is a technique with enough destructive force to partially destroy a star, but since it may also wipe out Gravimon itself, it is a self-destructive attack never meant to be used. Over the course of a great deal of time, Gravimon can regenerate itself afterwards, but not even Gravimon knows how long this will take."

To successfully Digivolve into a MetalGreymon, a Greymon must face several mighty foes and defeat them in battle. Its attacks are said to be as powerful as a nuclear warhead. MetalGreymon fires bionic missiles from a hatch that opens in its chest.\n\n\u25a0Effects of the X Antibody on MetalGreymon (Virus)\u2019s DigiCore:\nEach of its mechanized parts have been updated. In particular, the Alterous Trident Arm on its left arm has been enhanced and remodeled, and can now switch between Blitz Mode and Blast Mode. It also comes equipped with an energy booster that exceeds the speed of sound at maximum output. MetalGreymon (Virus) (X Antibody) uses its special move Energy Blitz to fly at maximum speed and pierce the enemy in Blitz Mode, or Pandemic Destroyer to shoot viral energy in Blast Mode. The virus in the latter technique is toxic, and infectious enough to be designated a calamity."

As a result, it hardly ever bothers to land, spending most of its life in the air. It is believed to be capable of flying at speeds exceeding Mach 20, meaning very few Digimon could likely survive an aerial battle with Wingdramon. Wingdramon\u2019s special moves include Blaze Sonic Breath, where it breathes out a blast of scorching hot air faster than the speed of sound, and Exploding Sonic Lance, which involves plummeting into a foe at maximum speed to run them through with the lance on its back. Also, since Wingdramon can fly faster than the speed of sound, it creates a shockwave known as Wing Blast every time it moves. This means that even those who can avoid its special moves still take some damage."
